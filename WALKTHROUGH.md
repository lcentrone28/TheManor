#### This is a walkthrough for my game The Manor, for those who have already completed the game and want to know what they might have missed and/or for those who want to see how it works without as much of a challenge.

---

If you say anything but “yes” when you first meet Niles you will get a secret achievement

If you complete all games without losing a single life you will get a secret achievement

You get an achievement for each game you lose a life to, for each consensus conundrum outcome, and for beating the game on the difficulty chosen

If you get the max 7 coffee coins hidden throughout the game you can buy the moccachino from the coffee machine which will give you a hint on the first number of the conservatory code and give you a secret achievement

The hand of providence cannot make the same choice two times in a row within the same game, if you lose a life it resets

The conservatory code does not have zeros
