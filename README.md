## You have been invited to The Manor to participate in a series of trials, sponsored by rich people with nothing better to do who like to bet on the contestants.
### Compete in trials, collect coffee coins, make a million bucks and lasting friendships.

I created “The Manor” to showcase the things I learned in the first 15 “days” (lessons) of the 100 Days of Code™: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu as well as enforce that learning and build upon it.

My process was as follows:
- I broke each mini game and complex mechanic into different modules and laid out what I needed each to do.
- I then created a flow chart that combined all aspects together and adjusted the chart and the plan as needed.
- Next I wrote out a to-do list of variables, functions, and the like. Troubleshooting the logic and moving things around before cluttering up my modules.
- Once I had a solid game plan with sound logic I wrote out the story of the game and collected the statistical information needed for the higher/lower mini game.
- Finally once all project planning was complete I began putting it into practice in PyCharm, adjusting as necessary and testing after each step.

Not all projects from the bootcamp were able to be included and not all mechanics from the game were taught in the bootcamp but it served its purpose nonetheless. This was my first major project working with Python.
